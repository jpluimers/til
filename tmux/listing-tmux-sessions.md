This is really useful after discovering `tmux` and you have no idea what `tmux` session you were in [if any]. It is even more useful when vim's `:` command line prompt has been remapped to the `spacebar` and instead of `:w` writing the file, the `âŒ˜-w` close terminal window command is hit instead.

- List tmux sessions 

```sh
$ tmux ls
#=> 0: 2 windows (created ...
#=> ruby: 4 windows (created ...
```

- Open the session you want

```sh
# a | at | attach + -t [target-session] + the session number/name

$ tmux a -t 0
#=> emotional happiness
```
