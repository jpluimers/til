### Adobe InDesign

Going through a basic workflow of: `âŒ˜-D` or `File > Place...`, `Select PDF`, `Open`. I noticed a `.xlsx` or Excel file was selectable to place. It was a moment of enlightenment. My thought process flowed along the lines of:

```sh
> "Really?" -> '...' 
> "all this time..." -> 'disbelief'
> "I never have to manually create tables/tabbed text from spreadsheets again" -> 'happiness'
```

### Placing spreadsheet data as a Table

1. `Command+D` opens `File > Place...` action
2. Select an Excel file
3. Check `Show Import Options` + `Open`

| options include: |
|------------------|
| `Sheet` selection |
| `Cell Range` |
| `Table` un/formatted |
| `Cell Alignment` |

- `Unformatted Table` is a blank slate and is in serious need of styling
- `Formatted Table` retains its Excel look...for the most part
- `Unformatted Tabbed Text` when you want the data, and not tables
