When working with SPOT color in `[insert Adobe App]` I would only pay attention to the number, PANTONE 343 200 etc. Though it was weird that some 343's were duller than the other 343s, but didnt really matter to me, I just needed a color space to print a SPOT plate at the time.

While searching through [Stack Exchange Network] the [Graphic Design] site got my attention, as did a question asking [What is a spot/Pantone colour?] My knowledge of a spot color was: `a dedicated color space to output the proper plates` for 2-3 color print jobs. The answer to the above question expanded on that in a way that now seems obivious. The most obivious part was describing `C` vs `U`:

- `C` = `Coated` \| paper with low ink absorption
- `U` = `Uncoated` \| paper with high soaking ability

`C` vs `U` in an app shows a simulated output of the same color on different paper. This explains why some PANTONE colors were duller than others.
